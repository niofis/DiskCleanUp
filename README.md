DiskCleanUp
===========

This utility recursively searches the specified folder, trying to match folders/files with compressed archives that might have been the source. This duplicity usually happens when using the 'Extract to' feature of some archive managers.

###Characteristics
* Traverses the folder tree of the specified directory.
* Lists files/folders with their posible archive source.
* Allows eliminating either sources, files/folders or both.
